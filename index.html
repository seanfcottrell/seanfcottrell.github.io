        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Recent graduate from the Michigan State University Departments of Mathematics and Economics. Current PhD student in the Department of Computational Mathematics, Sciences, and Engineering. Also currently a research assistant in the MSU Department of Mathematics WeiLab. Feel free to check out my <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/seanfcottrell" target="_blank">Linkedin</a>!</p>

        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>My research is primarily concerned with the application of advanced mathematical methods to the analysis of biomolecular / biomedical data. 
            Specifically, the topological analysis of transcriptome data, including single cell, spatial, and multi-modal data; as well as the design 
            and implementation of Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques for computational biology. 
            More broadly, I am also interested in mathematical biophysics and computational drug design. Below is a list of recent papers, with a more detailed accounting of my work available on my <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=C-q3hLwAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Google Scholar page</a>. The links in the header also provide some brief descriptions of recent projects. </p>
