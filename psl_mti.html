        <p>This is a novel approach to biomarker discovery that makes use of Persistent Sheaf Laplacians, a next generation tool in Topological Data Analysis, to study the topological and geometric structure of gene co-expression networks for the purpose of identifying molecular targets.  </p>

        <p>Given the list of identified biomarkers, say APOE4 and CSF1R for Alzheimer's Disease, the method pivots to a Machine Learning based drug repurposing task, where we hope to identify a set of compounds that can be potentially repurposed to treat our disease.  </p>
        <p>Ultimately in our analysis of Alzheimer's the model was successful in identifying ... drugs that could serve as promising therapeutic candidates for targeting these molecular pathways / biomarkers.   </p>
